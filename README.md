🌱 IoT-Based Smart Farming System
📌 Project Overview
This project is an IoT-based system that monitors soil moisture, temperature, and humidity in real-time using sensors. The data is sent to a mobile application, allowing farmers to optimize irrigation schedules and improve crop yield and resource efficiency.

🚀 Why This Project is Useful
Efficient Irrigation: Helps prevent overwatering or underwatering.
Real-Time Monitoring: Farmers can check live sensor data from anywhere.
Improved Crop Yield: Enables data-driven decision-making for better farming practices.
Resource Optimization: Reduces water and electricity wastage.
🛠️ Getting Started
Hardware Setup:

Deploy IoT sensors in the field.
Connect them to a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi).
Software Setup:

Install required libraries and dependencies.
Set up the mobile app for real-time data visualization.
Connectivity:

Use Wi-Fi or LoRa for data transmission.
Store and process data using cloud or edge computing.
